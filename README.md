All-In-One Topology-Aware Particles Transformer Encoder (AI1-TAPTE)

Decription:
AI1-TAPTE is an advanced machine learning model based on a transformer encoder, specifically tailored for addressing jet assignment tasks in particle physics. It builds upon the SPANet (Symmetry-Preserving Attention Networks) model architecture, as detailed in the original paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03898.pdf) and GitHub repository (https://github.com/Alexanders101/SPANet). The primary objective of AI1-TAPTE is to enhance the capabilities of the SPANet model by introducing new functionalities and refining the architecture to seamlessly handle Jet Pairing, Categorization, and Classification tasks simultaneously, hence the inclusion of "All-In-One" in its name.

In alignment with the core concept of SPANet and tailored to the requirements of jet reconstruction phenomenology, AI1-TAPTE aims to serve as a versatile tool for arbitrary event topologies. Beyond technical enhancements, the design philosophy of AI1-TAPTE prioritizes simplicity and user-friendliness, making it accessible to scientists with varying levels of programming expertise. The model is crafted to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring a smooth experience for researchers at any proficiency level.
